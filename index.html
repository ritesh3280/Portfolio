                    <div class="text">Hello, I'm Ritesh</div>
                    <p>I am a Computer Science freshman at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm an avid believer in exploring diverse interests, always up for new challenges.
                    <br>
                    <br>During my high school years, I was an active member of the robotics club, where I honed my programming and building skills, contributing to various exciting projects. Beyond robotics, I've dedicated time to a couple of personal projects where I could unleash my programming prowess. My toolbox includes proficiency in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.
                    <br>
                    <br>In addition to my tech passion, I have a deep love for sports, particularly soccer. The teamwork, strategy, and sheer thrill of the game resonate with me.
                    <br>
                    <br>As I embark on my academic journey, I am eagerly seeking internship opportunities for the summer of 2024 to further my skills and gain real-world experience in the field of computer science. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my journey and the projects I've undertaken.
